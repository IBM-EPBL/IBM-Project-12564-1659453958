<h2>ðŸ“ƒ About the project:</h2><i>
âœ¨ With Diverse people emerges different styles of writing, especially handwritten numbers where the ambiguity is very high and hence the need for  Handwritten digit recongition arises. <br>
âœ¨ The aim of this project is to help Business Analyst or anyone who is in need to understand or works with handwritten text. <br>
âœ¨ The predicted output gives a fair idea about the written text that is fed into the model with some level of certainity (which depends on how well we train the model) <br>
