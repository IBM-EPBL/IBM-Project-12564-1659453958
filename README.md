 <h3>IBM-Project-12564-1659453958</h3>  
 To take a look at the demo video, [Click Here](https://youtu.be/Q8JWZalA88g)
 
 The Application consists of:
 <ul>
  <li>Login Page</li>
  <li>Registration Page</li>
  <li>Prediction Page (Input/Output)</li>
 </ul>

<h2> Application workflow:</h2><i>
âœ¨ Users can register/login to the Application. <br>
âœ¨ Users are then redirected to the Secure Dashboard in which they can either select an Image or provide the Image Address of the image that will be used for Prediction. <br>
âœ¨ The input will then be processed by an already trained model which will carry out the prediction process and yields a result with certain confidence. <br>
âœ¨ The result with the highest confidence along with the input image uploaded will be displayed in the output Page. <br>

<h2>ðŸ“ƒ About the project:</h2><i>
âœ¨ With Diverse people emerges different styles of writing, especially handwritten numbers where the ambiguity is very high and hence the need for  Handwritten digit recongition arises. <br>
âœ¨ The aim of this project is to help Business Analyst or anyone who is in need to understand or works with handwritten text. <br>
âœ¨ The predicted output gives a fair idea about the written text that is fed into the model with some level of certainity (which depends on how well we train the model) <br>
